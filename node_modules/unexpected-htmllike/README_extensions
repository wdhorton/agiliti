Some adapters already exist, and can simply be used, or you can write your own
* [unexpected-htmllike-jsx-adapter](https://github.com/bruderstein/unexpected-htmllike-jsx-adapter)
for React elements (either from the shallow renderer, or as JSX / `React.createElement`)
* [unexpected-htmllike-reactrendered-adapter](https://github.com/bruderstein/unexpected-htmllike-reactrendered-adapter)
for rendered react elements, using [react-render-hook](https://github.com/bruderstein/react-render-hook) to obtain the full
virtual DOM tree.
